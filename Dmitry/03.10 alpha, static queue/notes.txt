memcpy(&p, buffer, sizeof(buffer))
    "sizeof(buffer)" needs to be "sizeof(packet)"

    writes 0's to some memory after variables on the stack past packet struct

remove buggy packet methods

very high chance that sprintf goes out of bounds too
    probably into loop() stack

    unsigned long in a string can be up to 10 digits
    10 * 5 + 4 * 2 = 58 max possible size of string

setPacketAge() somehow doesn't handle unsigned int correctly and treats it as 2 byte int at some point, causing an overflow
    replacing with .age += sleep_time fixes it

should just use stdint types for everything, to make types more obvious

removed setup_end_time
    doesnt take that much but adds mental clutter

TODO:
    really need to move common stuff outside
    for now can be in arduino libraries
        relative paths, etc doesn't work because of Arduino IDE
    later will be better when rx/tx is in the same file

    convert sleepydog
    packet_t definition
    expovariate
    some logging stuff
