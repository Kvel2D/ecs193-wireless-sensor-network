CHANGELOG

--------------------------------------
0.1.1 03.13.19

memcpy(&p, buffer, sizeof(buffer))
    "sizeof(buffer)" needs to be "sizeof(packet)"

    writes 0's to some memory after variables on the stack past packet struct

very high chance that sprintf goes out of bounds too
    probably into loop() stack

    unsigned long in a string can be up to 10 digits
    10 * 5 + 4 * 2 = 58 max possible size of string

    use Serial.print() instead

setPacketAge() somehow doesn't handle unsigned int correctly and treats it as 2 byte int at some point, causing an overflow
    replacing with .age += sleep_time fixes it

should just use stdint types for everything, to make types more obvious

removed setup_end_time
    doesnt take that much but adds mental clutter

moved out shared code to shared.h
    currently needs to be copied manually into rx/tx folders
