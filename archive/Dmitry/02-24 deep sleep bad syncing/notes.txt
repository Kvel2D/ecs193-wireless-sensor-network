need to pick some rates for extensive testing
shooting for node-to-node time of 1 minute

100,4000    = 1.292056  0:1:38:373
400,1000    = 0.618870  0:1:17:930
600,600     = 0.779810  0:1:12:977

recording the max-min-avg of node-to-node times for a very long duration
compare baseline vs sleepydog
    no noticeable difference, these specific rates unaffected?
    or not enough sim time?

going to try the specific rate that was bad in the last experiment
1000,2000
there is a big difference, though the rate is bad in general, baseline is in terms of hours

conclusion
    seems like sleepydog doesn't cause bad sync for all rates, but the logic for which it does and doesn't affect is unclear
    can use sleepydog without any modifications but need to keep it in mind
    if we encounter some bad perfomance in the implementation, need to simulate the rates with sleepydog time and/or try to add extra wait and see if sleepydog is the cuase
